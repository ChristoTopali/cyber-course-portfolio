# Darknet Diaries Ep. 72: Bangladesh Bank Heist Reflection

## Goal
Reflect on the Bangladesh Bank Heist from Darknet Diaries Ep. 72 and connect it to Cisco Module 2 concepts regarding attack techniques, financial transaction integrity, and persistent network reconnaissance.

## Steps
1. Listened to Darknet Diaries Episode 72 covering the Bangladesh Bank cyber heist.
2. Took notes on the attack timeline, SWIFT network manipulation, printer tampering, and transaction interception.
3. Prepared this structured reflection connecting the incident to core cybersecurity and threat actor principles.

## Findings

### 1. The incident in your own words
In February 2016, attackers attempted to steal nearly $1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh by issuing fraudulent transfer requests through the SWIFT banking network. They managed to successfully route $81 million into accounts in the Philippines before further transfers were blocked. What makes this case striking compared to traditional bank robberies is that the thieves used keyboards rather than weapons, exploiting digital trust systems from thousands of miles away.

### 2. The patient approach - months of preparation
The attackers remained hidden inside the bank's internal network for nearly a year after gaining initial access through a spear-phishing email. During this long dwell time, they quietly mapped out the network, studied internal workflows, and monitored how employees authorized large financial transactions. Patience was critical because it allowed the hackers to understand the exact timing and software mechanics needed to execute the heist without triggering immediate internal alarms.

### 3. The CIA principle
Integrity was the primary CIA leg targeted in this incident, as the attackers tampered with system logs, modified transaction confirmation software, and forged legitimate payment instructions. By compromising the integrity of the SWIFT terminal software, they ensured that unauthorized money transfers appeared completely authentic to the receiving banks. Confidentiality was also breached during the reconnaissance phase, but altering transaction records was the core mechanism of the theft.

### 4. The attack technique - SWIFT and the printer trick
The bank relied on a physical printer that automatically outputted paper confirmations for every SWIFT transaction to catch unauthorized activity. The attackers wrote custom malware that blocked this specific printer and altered transaction logs, hiding the fraudulent transfers over a long weekend. Delaying detection was just as important as evading firewalls, because it bought the attackers critical time to move the funds through casinos and money changers before anyone realized the cash was missing.

### 5. What went wrong for the attackers
The attackers were prevented from stealing the full $951 million due to a combination of a typo and coincidence, such as misspelling the word "foundation" as "fandation" on a routing instruction, which raised suspicion at a routing bank. Additionally, the timing coincided with a weekend holiday schedule across different international jurisdictions, which temporarily halted some automated routing systems. This shows that even highly sophisticated cyber operations can be derailed by simple human errors and multi-layered banking verification checks.

### 6. What could have helped - the defender's perspective
Implementing strict network segmentation between the bank's general local network and the critical SWIFT terminal environment would have drastically limited the damage. If Bangladesh Bank had enforced strict multi-factor authentication, endpoint monitoring, and hardware isolation on SWIFT systems, the attackers would not have been able to pivot from an ordinary phishing email into the core money transfer software.

### 7. The broader lesson - financial crime as cyberattack
This incident proved that state-sponsored cyber actors and advanced threat groups do not just attack for espionage or political sabotage; they also use cyber warfare techniques for pure financial gain. It highlighted that attackers will invest months of effort into targeting non-technical financial processes rather than just trying to crash servers. As a result, defenders must secure not only IT infrastructure, but also the real-world operational workflows and authorization chains that handle high-value assets.

### 8. Your personal takeaway
This episode made me appreciate how much cybersecurity relies on human vigilance and process verification, rather than just technical firewalls. I learned that cyberattacks aren't always fast-paced or chaotic—sometimes the most dangerous threats are the ones sitting silently in a network for months, learning how to blend in.
